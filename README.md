Hi! I'm Adrian Lorenzo ✌
I usually go by the online alias ilagon. 🐱‍👤
I fell in love with programming when I first learned C# while in college.
Pretty much awakened a God-complex in me as I felt like I could turn any idea into reality.
Currently teaching myself frontend and mobile app development using technologies such as:
- React(NextJS) 
- TailwindCSS
- Flutter

Hoping soon i'll have time (and the determination) to finally start learning game development with Godot!
