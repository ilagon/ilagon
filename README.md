Hi! I'm Lorenzo ✌
I usually go by the online alias ilagon.
I fell in love with programming when I first learned C# while in college.
Pretty much awakened a God-complex in me as I felt like I could turn any idea into reality.

Currently exploring technologies such as:
- Sveltekit
- Motion
- AdonisJS

Hoping soon i'll have time (and the determination) to finally start learning game development with Godot!
